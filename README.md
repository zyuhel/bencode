What is this?
=============

This project allows developers to encode or decode bencoded data strings in
PHP 5.3+. More information about bencode can be found at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode).
The format is primarily used in the .torrent file specification.

Why?
----

At one time I was involved in building a torrent tracker/index, and I wrote this
library to read and manipulate uploaded torrent files. I originally bundled it
in my [rchouinard/rych-components](https://github.com/rchouinard/rych-components)
project, but I've recently decided to break that package up into standalone
components.

How does it work?
-----------------

### Encoding an array

```php
<?php

use Rych\Bencode\Bencode;

$data = array(
    "string" => "bar",
    "integer" => 42,
    "array" => array(
        "one",
        "two",
        "three",
    ),
);

echo Bencode::encode($data);
```

The above outputs the bencode encoded string `d5:arrayl3:one3:two5:threee7:integeri42e6:string3:bare`.

### Decoding a string

```php
<?php

use Rych\Bencode\Bencode;

$string = "d5:arrayl3:one3:two5:threee7:integeri42e6:string3:bare";

print_r(Bencode::decode($string));
```

The above results the the following output:
```
Array
(
    [array] => Array
        (
            [0] => one
            [1] => two
            [2] => three
        )

    [integer] => 42
    [string] => bar
)
```
